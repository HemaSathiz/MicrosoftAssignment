This repository contains a detailed sample app that implements MVVM architecture 
using Room, LiveData, Retrofit,DataBinding, ViewModel,RxJava.

#### The app has following packages:
1. **models**: It contains all the data accessing and manipulating components.
2. **api**: It contains network calls and its interface.
3. **database**: It contains entity and dao class for storing the data in local
4. **helper**: It contains constant variables and common methods.
5. **ui**: View classes along with their corresponding ViewModel.

#### Classes have been designed in such a way that it could be inherited and maximize the code reuse.
